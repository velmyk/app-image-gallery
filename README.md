### NodeJS server for managing image gallery

In scope of this home work I implemented:

1. Simpe NodeJS server with some routing
2. Endpoint '/' to get last uploaded image.
3. Endpoint '/list' to view all available images.
4. Endpoint '/find' to find image by name (name should be sent in query parameter 'name').
5. Endpoint '/post' to upload images to server (form you can find in 'ui' directory).

To run app, please run `npm install` and `node index.js` in root directory of this home work.
Then go to `localhost:3000`.
To try different functions just folow proper links.
